## Learning Markdown
Our documentation is written using a lightweight markup language called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The language uses different kinds of punctuation marks to tell the computer compiler how to format our files without us as authors having to learn and use HTML proper.

In order to learn the syntax necessary for this project we recommend reviewing [Github's guide to Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Below is a cheatsheet of commonly needed formatting options:

```
# h1
## h2
### H3 
**bold**
_italic_
```
