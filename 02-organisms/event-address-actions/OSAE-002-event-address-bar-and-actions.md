Accessibility & Functional Requirements
OSAE-1: Audio Tour Section Module
- Audio Tour is h2

OSAE-2 Accessiblity Requirements - DRAFT / INCOMPLETE
- "Stephen A. S..." is h3
- use <address>? make sure address line breaks work
- "Directions" link  have aria-labelledby combining "Directions" and "Stephen A..."
- "Call" once refined follow pattern for telephones (see open issues)
- Visitor guide and Take a Tour have aria-labelledby to combine those labels with "Stephen A..." heading

OSAE-3 Accessiblity Requirements - DRAFT / INCOMPLET
- “Schomburg...” is h2
- Wondering if reading order should actually put “Schomburg...” before the date/time information since that logistical information sort of belongs to heading; we’ll know more when see in template
- buttons/links  have arial-labelledby to make more distinct. Should pull in the name of the event. So we’ll need to give that a unique id. So will read “Register [Name of Event]”
