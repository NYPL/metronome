# NYPL Design System Documentation
This project sits alongside our [NYPL Design System](https://github.com/nypl/nypl-design-system) to document known functional requirements, accessibility requirements, statuses, and open issues across the system. It runs using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) under the hood and is served up on [Github Pages](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system-docs/#/). We are currently pre-V1 and have further plans for this documentation systemâ€”please see [the wiki](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system-docs/wiki/North-Star-for-this-Documentation) for further information.

## Quick Start: Running This Project Locally
