## Blue Skies
The follow is a list of things we'd like this documentation site to accomplish or be capable of.

- Site should be searchable
- Site should be editable
- Site should have a table of all of the components with their statuses (in-progress, in-review, complete), and the implementation libraries' statuses (Twig template, React component, ERB template)
- Site should have authorship data, last revision date(s) on files, and descriptions of changes made (such as a git commit)
- Site should have roles so that certain users can lock components and their documentation to prevent edits unless author has a certain role
- In-progress components should have a working draft that is still visible on the site
- We should be able to see everywhere a component is usedâ€”for example, ResearchNow has a section that pulls in dynamically all of the components it is using for QA to be able to see all of that information in one place
- Site should have an intro page and a Getting Started Guide
- Components should display the relationships of where they are used and link back to their lower-level functional requirements (e.g., "Event Status Bar" uses "Button", link to the button component to see its requirements)
- Components should have: link to Figma instance for designers, IA (functional specs and accessibility), look & feel, their status, a built and interactive display of the component in-action, and the numbered documentation that Ellen created listing functional requirements.
- We should be able to number the components on the page in our documentation site to write documentation for them. This should automatically add the number to that component in Figma.
