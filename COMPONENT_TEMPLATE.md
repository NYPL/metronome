## Component Description
A brief overview along with some notes about when and where the component is used goes here.

## Functional Requirements

For templates, these should be separated into numeric parts for each component and describe how these components are meant to relate to each other and list what subcomponents it is built up of and link to their documentation. Within a subcomponent, it should list if it is built of other subcomponents, and link to the subdocumentation for those subcomponents.

Code snippets also belong in here.
